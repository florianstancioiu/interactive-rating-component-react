## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - JavaScript with types
- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) - For testing
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/) - Build tool

### What I learned

- I learned that the ratio of color contrast between the foreground (`color` property) and the background (`background-color` property) must be of at least `4.5:1`.
- I also learned that if you open the `color` property in dev tools (firefox & chrome), the colorpicker popup that appears has contrast information, which is really useful for accessibility

### Continued development

- I still have to understand the `aria-*` attributes and I am not entirely sure when to use the `<section>` tag
